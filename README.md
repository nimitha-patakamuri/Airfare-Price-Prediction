## Description

The airfare prediction project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the price of airplane tickets. By inputting variables like date, day, locations, etc., the model will provide an estimated price for the travel.

## Features

- Takes input variables such as date, day, locations, and other relevant features.
- Predicts the price of airplane travel based on these inputs.

## Tools and Technologies

This project utilizes various regression algorithms and selects the best-performing model for predictions. The algorithms tested include:

- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Bayesian Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Elastic Net
- Lasso Regression
- Linear Regression
- Quantile Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression

Among these, the Decision Tree Regression algorithm was found to be the best for this project.

Other technologies used:

- Pickle for model serialization.
- Flask for creating the web application.

## Dataset

The project uses a custom dataset named `vistara.csv`.
